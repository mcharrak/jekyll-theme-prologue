My research interests are in statistical Machine Learning and Deep Learning especially in Bayesian inference and generative models such as Bayesian network, Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with applications in healthcare, medicine, social science and environment. I want to understand the data processes, its underlying distribution and properties by developing interpretable and robust statistical models.
