My research interests lie in the general area of Data Science. Particularly in Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence, as well as their applications in Representation Learning, Information Security, Generative Modeling and Natural Language Understanding and Healthcare. I want to be able to understand data, its underlying distribution and properties by developing interpretable models and graphs. Simply put: I enjoy numerical reasoning.
