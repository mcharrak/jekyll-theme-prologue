My research interests lie in the general area of Data Science and Cognitive Science. Particularly in Deep Learning for Artificial Intelligence, Neuroscience and Linguistics as well as their applications in Representation Learning, Information Security and Natural Language Processing. I want to be able to understand data, its underlying distribution and properties by developing interpretable models and graphs. Simply put: I enjoy numerical reasoning.
