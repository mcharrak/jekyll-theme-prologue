My research interests lie in the general area of Machine Learning, particularly in Deep Learning and Data Analysis, as well as their applications in Representation Learning, Information Security, Generative Modeling and Natural Language Understanding. I want to be able to understand data, its underyling distribution and properties. Simply put: I enjoy making numerical reasoning.
