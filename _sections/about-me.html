<p>I am a final year Electrical Engineering and Information
  Technology student at TU Munich. Currently, I am working on
  Deep Generative Models for Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  using Variational Autoencoders (VAE) at ETH Zurich. I am passionate
  about Data Science and Deep Learning because it is fun to dig into 
  data outside of my subject area, extract insights and gain knowledge
  in various forms. Besides that, I am an avid traveler who captures 
  beautiful moments with his camera. Having not only lived but also
  studied and researched in Germany, France, United Arab Emirates, United
  States of America, Canada and Switzerland; I truely see myself as a cosmopolitan
  who over the years developed an attitude of gratitude and the ability to see
  the positive in every obstacle I encounter and overcome.
