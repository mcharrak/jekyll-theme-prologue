<p>I am a final year Electrical Engineering and Information
  Technology student at TU Munich. Currently, I am working on
  Deep Generative Models for Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  using Variational Autoencoders (VAE) at ETH Zurich. I am passionate
  about Bayesian methods in statistical Machine Learning and Deep Learning. 
  Moreover, I enjoy digging into and working on research projects outside of my expertise, to extract
  insights from data and to learn new things every day. Besides research, I am an avid traveler who captures 
  beautiful moments with his camera. I have lived, studied and researched in Germany, France, 
  United Arab Emirates (UAE), the United States of America (USA), Canada, Switzerland and
  the United Kingdom (UK). My parents are from Poland and Morocco. I was born and grew up in Germany. 
  Therfore, I truely see myself as a cosmopolitan who over the years has learned to appreciate and be grateful
  for all the variety and wisdom other cultures and societies have to offer.
