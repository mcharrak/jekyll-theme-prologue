<p>I am a final year Electrical Engineering and Information
  Technology student at TU Munich. Currently, I am working on
  Deep Generative Models for Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  using Variational Autoencoders (VAE) at ETH Zurich. I am passionate
  about Data Science and Deep Learning because it is fun to dig into 
  data outside of my subject area, extract insights and gain knowledge
  in various forms. Besides that, I am an avid traveler who captures 
  beautiful moments with his camera. Having not only lived but also
  studied and researched in Germany,France, United Arab Emirates, United
  States of America, Canada and Switzerland; I truely see myself as a
  cosmopolitan realizing the positive things in every situation.
